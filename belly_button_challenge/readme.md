# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
## Project Overview
The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard is an interactive web application that visualizes the bacterial species (microbiomes) found in human navels. This project uses data from a JSON file and visualizes it using D3.js and Plotly.js to create dynamic charts. Users can select different test subjects and view the top 10 bacterial cultures found in their navel, represented through bar and bubble charts.

## Features

Bar Chart: Displays the top 10 OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) found in the selected individual.
Bubble Chart: Represents each sample with OTU IDs on the x-axis, sample values on the y-axis, and marker size and color representing additional data dimensions.
Demographic Information Panel: Shows demographic information of the selected individual.
