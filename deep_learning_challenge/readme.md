By introducing additional hidden layers, changing activation functions, implementing dropout and batch normalization, and adjusting the learning rate, the optimized model aimed to improve performance and prevent overfitting.

#### Recommendations

For future work, considering different model architectures and techniques could further improve performance:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: While typically used for image data, 1D CNNs can be applied to time series or sequence data, which might be beneficial if there are sequential features in the dataset.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Useful for sequential data and might capture temporal dependencies in the data.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combining the predictions of multiple models to improve overall performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematically searching for the best model parameters using techniques like grid search or random search.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to better capture the underlying patterns in the data.

The combination of these methods could lead to further improvements in the model's accuracy and robustness, providing a more reliable tool for predicting the success of charity-funded projects.
