# Credit Risk Analysis Report
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of a logistic regression model in predicting the loan status (healthy loan vs. high-risk loan) based on various features such as loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, and total debt. The ultimate goal is to determine whether this model can be reliably used by the company to assess credit risk.

## Results
Accuracy Score: 99%
Precision Score:
For healthy loans (0): 100%
For high-risk loans (1): 88%
Recall Score:
For healthy loans (0): 100%
For high-risk loans (1): 91%

## Summary
The logistic regression model demonstrates a high level of accuracy (99%) in predicting loan status, with excellent performance in identifying healthy loans (precision and recall of 100%). However, while the precision (88%) and recall (91%) for high-risk loans are slightly lower, they are still quite strong, indicating that the model is reliable for practical use.

Given these results, I recommend using this logistic regression model for credit risk assessment. The model’s high accuracy and strong performance metrics justify its deployment in a real-world setting, ensuring that the majority of high-risk loans can be effectively identified while minimizing the risk of misclassifying healthy loans. ​
